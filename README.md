# Director-Research
Research to adapt the environment to the current succes of the player.

The aim of this project is to adapt the environment of the agar.io
inspired game to the current succes of the 'Uber Agent'.
All the other agents wander around aimlessly,
while the uber agents actively tries to win the game.

There is also a director AI that makes the game easier
for the losing party so, even though the 'Uber Agent'
is far more skilled than the others, their chance of winning is about the same.
