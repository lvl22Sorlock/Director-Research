# Director-Research
The aim of this project is to create a director AI for an agar.io inspired game.
There is 1 skilled agent, while the other agents just wander around aimlessly.

The aim of this project is to adapt the environment of the agar.io
inspired game to the current succes of the 'Uber Agent'.
All the other agents wander around aimlessly,
while the uber agents actively tries to win the game.

The director AI makes the game easier
for the losing party so, even though the 'Uber Agent'
is far more skilled than the others, their chance of winning is about the same.
